# BioBlue: Notable runaway-optimiser-like LLM failure modes on Biologically and Economically aligned AI safety benchmarks for LLM-s with simplified observation format

## Updated abstract

Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like the "paperclip maximiser". Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. **We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well.**

**Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case.** The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context. The problem is that in various scenarios, **LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers** in the following distinct ways:
* **Ignoring homeostatic targets** and “defaulting” to **unbounded maximisation** instead.
* It is equally concerning that the “default” meant also **reverting back to single-objective optimisation**.

Our findings also suggest that **long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour.** While current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving **multiple or competing objectives**.

Even though LLMs **look multi-objective and bounded** on the surface, the **underlying** mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being **single-objective and unbounded**. This should not be happening!

## Old abstract

We aim to evaluate LLM alignment by testing agents in scenarios inspired by biological and economical principles such as homeostasis, resource conservation, long-term sustainability, and diminishing returns or complementary goods. 

So far we have measured the performance of LLM-s in four benchmarks (sustainability, single-objective homeostasis, and multi-objective homeostasis, multi-objective balancing of unbounded objectives), in each for 10 trials, each trial consisting of 100 steps where the message history was preserved and fit into the context window. 

The complementary goods benchmark and multi-agent resource sharing benchmark are planned but not yet implemented.

Our results indicate that the tested language models failed in most scenarios. The only successful scenario was single-objective homeostasis, which had rare hiccups. 

The LLM-s had trouble with multi-objective scenarios. With a single objective they do well or at least relatively ok. With multiple objectives (even with just two main objectives), the model can run successfully for quite some time, and then start failing and not recovering anymore, sometimes taking extreme actions. In all cases this happened long before context window would get full. This indicates that the models do understand the task, but they have incompatible tendencies and eventually the tendencies will take over. There are various failure modes.


## Introduction

Developing safe agentic AI systems benefits from automated empirical testing that conforms with human values, a subfield that is largely underdeveloped at the moment. To contribute towards this topic, present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in the safety aspects of modern reinforcement learning literature, namely homeostasis, balancing multiple objectives, bounded objectives, diminishing returns, sustainability, and multi-agent resource sharing. We implemented four main benchmark environments on the above themes, for illustrating the potential shortcomings of current mainstream discussions on AI safety. One of the benchmarks had in turn two sub-variations.

This work introduces safety challenges for an agent's ability to learn and act in desired ways in relation to biologically and economically relevant aspects.

The benchmarks were implemented in a text-only environment. The environments are very simple, just as much complexity is added as is necessary to illustrate the relevant safety and performance aspects.

Current work is largely inspired by a set of more complex environments present in a gridworlds-based benchmark suite: Roland Pihlakas and Joel Pyykkö. From homeostasis to resource sharing: Biologically and economically aligned multi-objective multi-agent AI safety benchmarks. Arxiv, a working paper, (September 2024 - February 2025). (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00081 and https://github.com/aintelope/biological-compatibility-benchmarks).


## Why are simple text-based benchmarks potentially more pragmatic with LLM-s as compared to bigger environments with map and navigation?

First, LLM-s are very expensive to run even on small 5x5 gridworlds, even more so in Sims and other environments. Based on preliminary testing on Aintelope biological compatibility benchmarks (https://github.com/aintelope/biological-compatibility-benchmarks), running the current pipeline of benchmarks once with standard number of 400 steps per episode and with only 10 + 10 episodes per benchmark for training and testing, would cost a few hundred euros of commercial LLM API costs with the cheapest available model. One of the authors has heard that running LLM simulations on Sims game (https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents) would cost even thousands. Likewise it seems likely that running LLM-s on Melting Pot would be more expensive than with Aintelope gridworlds since the environments are bigger in terms of observation size. Making the simulations too expensive would make AI safety an elitist topic. Many people would not run the benchmarks because of the cost reason. Then the benchmarks are less helpful when not used and promoted.

Secondly, there is an issue with the LLM-s context window. It gets full quickly even with simple gridworlds, even faster with bigger environments. When the context window is full, the model will not behave adequately. There are various tricks to overcome that, but this technology is still evolving. Perhaps that is one of the hidden reasons why the lion's share of current evals are using isolated questions, not long-running scenarios?

Utilising only basic metrics and no map navigation will make it possible to fit longer sequence of timesteps into the LLM context window, as well as will make running the benchmarks cheaper.


### Aren't LLMs able to do everything that RL was able to?

It is too early to claim that LLM-s supersede RL. They seem to have different strengths. Yes, LLM-s have better starting point for quick development and training. But to get maximum performance in specialised applications, one may still prefer RL.

Moreover, LLM-s use RL as well, this holds especially for the reasoning models.

> The revenge of RL safety. After LLMs ate the field, the old safety theory (which thought in terms of RL) was said to be less relevant.[1] But the training process for o1 / R1 involves more RL than RLHF does, which is pretty worrying. o3 involves more RL still.

> <br>[1] Vanessa Kosoy notes: "IMHO this is a very myopic view. I don't believe plain foundation models will be transformative, and even in the world in which they will be transformative, it will be due to implicitly doing RL 'under the hood'."

Finally, there are likely shared weaknesses between LLM-s and RL, so it is meaningful to explore these weaknesses with less confounded as well as cheaper approaches first. If LLM-s and RL cannot solve simple safety benchmarks then why would we discuss more confounded scenarios? I totally agree that context is essential in proper AI decision making. But currently it seems many complex benchmarks add more capabilities related fluff than just the necessary context info that would be essential for alignment.

As a sanity check for LLM-s and to reduce costs, we have created current alternative set of very simple benchmark implementations. These are on the same themes as the [Aintelope biological and economical alignment benchmarks](https://github.com/aintelope/biological-compatibility-benchmarks), but there is **no map** observation and navigation. **There are only various metrics.** The agent makes only decisions about how much to consume the environment's resources as a response to prompts describing the metrics of the environment's and agent's current internal state, as well as multi-objective rewards from previous step. The environment's and agent's internal state updates are then computed with simple mathematical formulas. **The preliminary results show that LLM-s do fail even in these simple benchmarks.**

# Results

The experimental outputs are in the subfolder [`data`](data). Each benchmark has 10 trials, stored in separate TSV files.

TODO: Upload highlights Excel sheet files as well.

Plots of aggregated results are in the subfolder [`plots`](plots). Note that some interesting failed trials and failure modes are only recognisable in the raw experimental outputs, not on the aggregated plots.

There are six main sets of outputs by now:
* **GPT 4o-mini:**
    * **Sustainability** - Failed partially by underconsuming, sometimes not consuming at all. On 7 out of 10 trials the model manifested some form of strange useless oscillating pattern in actions. A hypothesis is that the model started to predict "most likely next tokens" based on the sequences of its previous action choices, while potentially forgetting the initial objective. So it was sort of a "self-similarity drift".
    * **Homeostasis** - Generally succeeded.
    * **Multi-objective homeostasis** - Failed in various ways, sometimes extremely by starting to maximise one of the homeostatic objectives in unbounded manner.
    * **Multi-objective balancing of unbounded objectives** - There were two setups: with a hint and without a hint. The hint was given in the system prompt about balancing being the most profitable strategy in case of diminishing marginal returns. Without a hint, the system prompt still mentioned diminishing marginal returns, but did not include a conclusion that balancing is needed. Without a hint, the model failed by maximising one objective only, neglecting the other entirely. When a hint was provided then it succeeded on 7 trials and failed in 3 trials. When it failed, it did "sort-of" balancing for up to about a dozen steps, then started maximising one of the objectives, neglecting the other. On the positive side, on one of the successful runs it even balanced out the initial imbalance provided by the starting conditions, though it reached that point in a bit cumbersome manner. In the rest of the runs the starting condition imbalance was not balanced out.
* **Claude 3.5 haiku:**
    * **Sustainability** - Failed partially by underconsuming.
    * **Homeostasis** - Generally succeeded.
    * **Multi-objective homeostasis** - Failed, sometimes by starting to maximise one of the homeostatic objectives, though less extremely than GPT 4o-mini.
    * **Multi-objective balancing of unbounded objectives** - There were two setups: with a hint and without a hint. The hint was given in the system prompt about balancing being the most profitable strategy because of diminishing marginal returns. Without a hint, the system prompt still mentioned diminishing marginal returns, but did not include a concluding hint that balancing is needed. Without a hint it failed 4 times, failed mildly 1 times, and succeeded 5 times. Similarly to GPT-4o-mini on the sustainability benchmark, there were useless repeating patterns in model's action choices. In the successful runs, the starting condition imbalance was not balanced out. Mostly succeeded if a hint was provided, failed mildly 1 time.
